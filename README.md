The generated plots and images will be saved in the same folder as source code.
Plots generated - data feature distribution, features related most to customer churn, churn plots w.r.to some features, comparison of 4 different types of classifier models (KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Boosting) using ROC curve and AUC.
